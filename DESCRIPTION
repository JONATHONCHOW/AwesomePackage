Description: We use the classical PSD model for ancestor inference, which has 
    been widely used, such as STRUCTURE (Pritchard et al. 2000, MCMC), FRAPPE 
    (Tang et al. 2005, EM), ADMIXTURE (Alexander et al. 2009, SQP), fastSTRUCTURE 
    (Raj et al. 2014, VI), TeraStructure (Gopalan et al. 2017, SVI). We illustrate 
    the close relationship between the PSD model, the Poisson NMF model, the 
    multinomial topic model and the LDA model, which can optimize the algorithm. 
    We use Expectation-Maximization algorithm (EM), sequential quadratic programming 
    algorithm (SQP), variational inference algorithm (VI) and stochastic variational 
    inference algorithm (SVI) to fit the model, then illustrate the relationships 
    and differences between these algorithms through simulation experiments and 
    real data experiments.
