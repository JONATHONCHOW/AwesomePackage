Description: We use the classical PSD model for ancestor inference, which has 
    been widely used, such as ADMIXTURE, FRAPPE. We illustrate the close 
    relationship between the PSD model, the Poisson NMF model and the 
    multinomial topic model, which can optimize the algorithm. We use 
    Expectation-Maximization algorithm (EM), co-ordinate descent algorithm 
    (CD), sequential quadratic programming algorithm (SQP) and stochastic 
    variational inference algorithm (SVI) to fit the model, and illustrate 
    the differences between these algorithms through simulation experiments 
    and real data experiments.
