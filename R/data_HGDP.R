#' @title Sample data from the Human Genome Diversity Project
#'
#' @description A group of scientists at Stanford University have collaborated
#'     on a large study to understand genetic diversity in human populations.
#'     We analyzed genomic DNA from 1,043 individuals from around the world,
#'     determining their genotypes at more than 650,000 SNP loci, with the
#'     Illumina BeadStation technology. Genomic DNA samples from these
#'     fully-consenting individuals were collected by the Human Genome
#'     Diversity Project (HGDP), in a collaboration with the Centre Etude
#'     Polymorphism Humain (CEPH) in Paris. The collection we tested is
#'     referred to as the "HGDP-CEPH Human Genome Diversity Cell Line Panel".
#'     They represent 51 different populations from Africa, Europe, the Middle
#'     East, South and Central Asia, East Asia, Oceania and the Americas.
