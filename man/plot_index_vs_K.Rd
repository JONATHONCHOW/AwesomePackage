\arguments{
\item{L}{A list where each element is a vector of index with respect to K.}

\item{methods}{A vector of the same length as \code{L} where each element is a name of the fitting algorithm, such as "em", "sqp", "vi", "svi".}

\item{index.id}{Choose index. Should be one of \code{"loglik"}, \code{"error"}, \code{"elbo"}, \code{"time"}.}

\item{start.point}{The initial point of K.}

\item{epsilon}{A small, positive number added to the vertical axis so that the
logarithmic scale does not over-emphasize very small differences.}

\item{colors}{The colors used to draw curves.}

\item{linetypes}{The line types used to draw curves.}

\item{linesizes}{The line sizes used to draw curves.}

\item{shapes}{The shapes used to draw points.}

\item{fills}{The fill colors used to draw points.}

\item{theme}{The ggplot2 theme.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object.
}
\description{
Draw a diagram of the relationship between the index and K using package ggplot2. The index can be loglikelihood, error, ELBO, and time.
